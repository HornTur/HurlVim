## 📥 Installation

### Quick Install

```bash
# Create your custom config directory
mkdir -p ~/.config/rv

# Navigate to the directory
cd ~/.config/rv

# Clone NvRush
git clone https://github.com/NvRush/NvRush.git ~/.config/rv

# Launch NvRush for the first time
NVIM_APPNAME=rv nvim

# Optional: add to zshrc or bashrc and then source it 
# alias rv='NVIM_APPNAME=rv nvim'
```

> [!NOTE]
> Replace `rv` with your preferred directory/launcher name (e.g., `nvrush`, `rv`, or `mynvim`).

### Setting Up an Alias (Optional but Recommended)

Add this to your shell configuration file (`~/.bashrc`, `~/.zshrc`, etc.):

```bash
alias rv='NVIM_APPNAME=rv nvim'
```

Then reload your shell:

```bash
source ~/.bashrc  # or ~/.zshrc for Zsh users
```

> [!NOTE]
> After the first launch, plugins will install automatically. This may take a minute — be patient and let the magic happen! ✨
